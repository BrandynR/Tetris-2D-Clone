# 2D Games: Tetris Clone

## [Tetris Clone](https://sharemygame.com/@BrandynR/2d-clone-tetris)
This repo is attempt at full functional Tetris clone. Complete with a pause/restart menu, music and sound effects, and the ability to hold a piece off to the side and call it back, this clone is updated remix of the 80's classic.

I chose to make a Tetris Clone because growing up I remember watching my Nana play Tetris (and eventually TetrisColor) on her GameBoy each night before bed. She would call me and my brother over each time she had beaten the game and rocket ship blasts off! These early memories of my Nana are some of my favorite, and if she were here I know she would love that I made this game for her.


# Original Project Guidelines

**This project is optional!**  While the AR / VR track focuses on 3D projects, you can also develop 2D projects in Unity and many of the concepts in programming for 2D and 3D games are the same.

## Requirements

### General

-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project
-   Use Unityâ€™s default  `.gitignore`  in your  `holbertonschool-unity`  directory
-   Push the entire project folder  `2D-clone`  to your repo
-   In your scripts, all your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
-   In your scripts, all your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags

#### 0. Classic clones  (advanced)

In Unity, create a 2D clone of one of the following classic games:

-   Galaga
-   Tetris
-   Pac-Man
-   Super Mario Bros.

Things to consider including in your game:

-   Start menu
-   Pause menu
-   Score / High score leaderboard
-   Two players

Create three builds of your game (Windows, Mac, Linux), zip them, and upload them to Google Drive or Dropbox.
- **[Windows](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ni4rkbkdtbueu5/Windows.zip?dl=0)**
- **[Mac](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tekqfw35kg7njbv/Mac.zip?dl=0)**
- **[Linux](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uqllj2ucghcso72/Linux.zip?dl=0)**
